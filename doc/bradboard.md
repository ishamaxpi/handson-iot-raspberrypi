# How to use breadboard??

Breadboards are special boards for prototyping (process of testing out an idea by creating a preliminary model)
electronics. They are covered with a grid of holes, which are split into electrically 
continuous rows.
 
In the central part there are two columns of rows that are side-by-side. This is designed to allow you to be able to insert an 
integrated circuit into the center. After it is inserted, each pin of the integrated circuit will have a row of electrically continuous 
holes connected to it.
 
In this way, you can quickly build a circuit without having to do any soldering or twisting wires together. Simply connect the parts that
are wired together into one of the electrically continuous rows.
 
On each edge of the breadboard, there typically runs two continuous bus lines. One is intended as a power bus and the other is intended as
a ground bus. By plugging power and ground respectively into each of these, you can easily access them from anywhere on the breadboard.
