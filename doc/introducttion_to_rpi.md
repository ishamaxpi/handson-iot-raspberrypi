# What is Raspberry Pi???

The Raspberry Pi (RPi) is an ultra **low-cost**,**credit-card sized**, single board computer or a Programmable PC. You can connect a monitor, keyboard and mouse and use it as a regular PC.  

Other than being a PC, it also has a **set of 40 Pins**, which can be controlled using code, and those can be used to control external components (motors, lights, switched, etc.).  

It will not run normal Operating Systems. There are specific Operating Systems which are specifically meant for the Pi.It comes in two models: **Model A & Model B**.

## History

### Motivation

The Raspberry Pi was created in Febuary 2012 by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, Oringially setup to promote and teach basic computer science in schools and colleges around the UK.  

The products were so popular due to their **low cost**,**efficiency** and durable which made them easy to modify and crate projects on. The device ran on **Linux**, a popular OS for developers, due to it being open-source.  

### Where does the name Raspberry Pi come from?

Raspberry is a reference to a fruit naming tradition in the old days of microcomputers. A lot of computer companies were named after fruit like Apple, BlackBerry, Apricot and more...  

The word ‘Pi’ is because the team behind the Raspberry Pi actually started working on developing a board that can run **Python Programming** Language and they further improvised from their goal and ended up designing a general-purpose computer.  

On the Raspberry Pi website they created 2 images that could be installed easily onto a sd card which would then act as the OS for the device, one of the images was based off of Debian a popular lightweight Linux OS and was called **Raspbian**, the other was called **Raspbmc** and was based off the popular media centre software Kodi (Formally known as XBMC).

## Latest release of Raspberry Pi 3 B+

The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ is the latest product in the Raspberry Pi 3 range. In celebration of Pi Day 2018, the Raspberry Pi foundation has announced the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, the Pi 3 Model B+ packs a **1.4GHz 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex A53 CPU made by Broadcom, dual-band 802.11ac wireless LAN support, Bluetooth 4.2 connectivity, and Gigabit Ethernet support over USB 2.0 connectivity (that’s up to 300Mbps).**  

The Pi 3 Model B+ is faster, but also consumes more power and might overheat during resource intensive tasks. That means its chip will be throttled above 70°C:  

< Below 70°C, we use the improvements to increase the core frequency to 1.4GHz. Above 70°C, we drop to 1.2GHz, and use the improvements to decrease the core voltage, increasing the period of time before we reach our 80°C thermal throttle; the reduction in power consumption is such that many use cases will never reach the throttle. Like a modern smartphone, we treat the thermal mass of the device as a resource, to be spent carefully with the goal of optimizing user experience.  

That said, the foundation says the Pi 3 Model B+ can sustain high performance for much longer periods than its predecessors. Adding a cooling fan on the back is apparently supported:

### Raspberry Pi B+ model has some additional features

1.) **More GPIO**: The GPIO header has grown to 40 pins, while retaining the same pinout for the first 26 pins as the Model B.  
2.) **More USB**: It has 4 USB 2.0 ports, compared to 2 on the Model B.  
3.) **Micro SD**: The SD card socket has been replaced with a much nicer push micro SD version.  
4.) **Lower power consumption**: Power consumption is reduced by between 0.5W and 1W.  
5.) **Better audio**: The audio circuit incorporates a dedicated low-noise power supply.
